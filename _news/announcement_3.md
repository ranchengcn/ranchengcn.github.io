We are thrilled to announce that our project **EvoGit** has won **First Place globally** in the **Multi-Agent Systems track** of the prestigious [**AgentX International Competition**](https://rdi.berkeley.edu/agentx/). Organized by the **University of California, Berkeley** and supported by leading tech companies such as **Google**, **Amazon**, and **Hugging Face**, AgentX is one of the most influential global platforms for advancing Large Language Model (LLM) agent technologies.

*Overview of the AgentX - LLM Agents MOOC Competition (Spring 2025)*

The competition drew nearly **1,000 teams** from over **100 countries and 800 universities worldwide**, including top institutions such as **UC Berkeley**, **Stanford**, and **CMU**. After multiple rounds of rigorous evaluation by a judging panel of 28 experts from **Google DeepMind**, **Meta FAIR**, **NVIDIA**, and other world-leading organizations, only **15 teams** advanced to the final on-site **Demo Day**.

Our team from PolyU’s Department of Data Science and Artificial Intelligence (DSAI) was the **only representative from China (including Hong Kong, Macau, and Taiwan)** to reach the finals—and ultimately secured **First Place** in the most technically challenging category with their pioneering project, **EvoGit**.

*EvoGit constructs the evolutionary process of code as a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG), where multiple agents collaboratively evolve and continuously develop.*

**EvoGit** is a decentralized multi-agent framework that reimagines software development as a continuously evolving process rather than a static task. It models the development lifecycle as a **Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)** of Git commits, where multiple agents independently propose incremental code changes or structural crossovers and collaborate **without** relying on centralized schedulers or explicit communication protocols.

This architecture enables **self-organizing**, **scalable**, and **resilient** agent behavior. By building on standard Git infrastructure, EvoGit also facilitates **seamless human-agent collaboration**, allowing developers to inspect, intervene, and co-create using familiar version control tools.

EvoGit represents a significant step toward building **evolvable LLM agents**—intelligent systems capable of autonomously improving their own structure and behavior over time.
