Recently, the IEEE Computational Intelligence Society (CIS) Awards Committee announced the results of the 2025 IEEE CIS Outstanding Early Career Award. I have been honored with this prestigious award. Established in 2010, this award recognizes exceptional achievements in the field of computational intelligence by young scholars under the age of 40, selecting one recipient annually.
