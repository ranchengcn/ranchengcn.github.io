I am currently an Associate Professor with the [Department of Data Science & Artificial Intelligence](https://www.polyu.edu.hk/dsai/) and [Department of Computing](https://www.polyu.edu.hk/comp/) at Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU). Previously, I was an Associate Professor with the [Department of Computer Science and Engineering](https://cse.sustech.edu.cn/en/) at Southern University of Science and Technology (SUSTech). I received the BSc degree from Northeastern University (China) in 2010 and the PhD degree from the University of Surrey (UK) in 2016. Additionally, I spent three years at Zhejiang University as a postgraduate student between 2010 and 2012, a period of cherished memories and personal growth.

My research philosophy is centered on *benefiting humanity by bridging nature and technology*. Within the broad domain of Artificial Intelligence (AI), my research focuses on advancing [Computational Intelligence (CI)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_intelligence) to tackle modeling and optimization challenges in complex systems. My primary research interests include Evolutionary Computation (EC) and Representation Learning (RL), with an emphasis on developing efficient and scalable computational methods leveraging modern hardware acceleration. As a representative effort, I initiated the [EvoX](https://evox.group/) project, aiming at bridging traditional EC methodologies with advanced GPU computing infrastructures. 

I am the founding chair of [IEEE Computational Intelligence Society (CIS) Shenzhen Chapter](https://r10.ieee.org/shenzhen-cis/). I am serving as an Associate Editor/Editorial Board Member for several journals, including: *ACM Transactions on Evolutionary Learning and Optimization*, *IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation*, *IEEE Transactions on Emerging Topics in Computational Intelligence*, *IEEE Transactions on Cognitive and Developmental Systems*, *IEEE Transactions on Artificial Intelligence*, etc.

I am the recipient of the *IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation Outstanding Paper Awards* (2018, 2021), the *IEEE CIS Outstanding PhD Dissertation Award* (2019), the *IEEE Computational Intelligence Magazine Outstanding Paper Award* (2020), and the *IEEE CIS Outstanding Early Career Award* (2025). I have been featured among the World's Top 2% Scientists (2020â€“2024) and the *Clarivate Highly Cited Researchers* (2023, 2024). I am a Senior Member of IEEE.
