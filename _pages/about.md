I am currently an Associate Professor with the Hong Kong Polytechnic University. My research focuses on advancing Computational Intelligence to tackle modeling and optimization challenges in complex systems. My primary research interests include evolutionary computation and representation learning, with an emphasis on developing efficient and scalable computational methods.

I am the founding chair of IEEE Computational Intelligence Society (CIS) Shenzhen Chapter. I am serving as an Associated Editor/Editorial Board Member for several journals, including: ACM Transactions on Evolutionary Learning and Optimization, IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation, IEEE Transactions on Emerging Topics in Computational Intelligence, IEEE Transactions on Cognitive and Developmental Systems, IEEE Transactions on Artificial Intelligence, etc.

I am the recipient of the IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation Outstanding Paper Awards (2018, 2021), the IEEE CIS Outstanding PhD Dissertation Award (2019), the IEEE Computational Intelligence Magazine Outstanding Paper Award (2020), and the IEEE CIS Outstanding Early Career Award (2025). I have been featured as among the World's Top 2\% Scientists (2020 - 2024) and the Clarivate Highly Cited Researchers (2023, 2024). I am a Senior Member of IEEE.
